# First Approach
    #We can add all the elements from that range - the sum(all elements from array) and we will get the result as missing elements
    #Note-(This approach have some issue as the sum may overflow the default datatype range and start behaving appropriately)
#Second Approach

    #We can xor all elements in array and in that range : We will end up with that missing element

#Third Approach
    #We can do one thing, we can sort and get the element
