#
# Design Class Student with following information :
#
# students = {
# "Peter": {"age": 10, "address": "Lisbon"},
# "Isabel": {"age": 11, "address": "Sesimbra"},
# "Anna": {"age": 9, "address": "Lisbon"},
# "Rust": {"age": 24, "address": "Lousiana"},
# "marty": {"age": 9, "address": "Texas"},
# "Kendrick": {"age": 43, "address": "LA"},
# "Lamar": {"age": 34, "address": "London"}
# }
#
# 1. Implement a method to return number of students are in the "students" dict
# 2. Implement a method that receives the students dict and returns the average age
# 3. Implement a method that receives the students dict and an address, and returns
# a list with the name of all students which address matches the address in the
# argument. For instance, invoking "find_students(students, â€™Lisbonâ€™)" should return
# Peter and Anna.
# 4. Implement a decorator to override the address of students with age above 20 as 'central' and return updated dictionary as O/P
